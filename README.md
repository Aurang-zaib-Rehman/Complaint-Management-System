# Complaint Management System (Frontend)

This project provides a modern **React + Vite** frontend for a **Provincial Government Complaint Management System**.
It is designed as a **MERN-style portfolio project**, focusing only on the **frontend**, while the backend can be integrated later.

The application allows **citizens to submit and track complaints** and **administrators to manage and resolve them** through role-based dashboards.



## Project Purpose

This project is built to:

* Demonstrate modern React frontend development
* Showcase clean project structure and performance-focused design
* Practice real-world features like authentication, dashboards, and CRUD operations
* Serve as a strong portfolio project for internships and jobs



## Tech Stack

The following technologies are used in this project:

* **React** – User interface library
* **Vite** – Fast development server and build tool
* **JavaScript (ES6+)** – Core programming language
* **Tailwind CSS** – Utility-first CSS framework
* **React Router DOM** – Client-side routing
* **Redux Toolkit** – Global state management (authentication & roles)
* **React Query (TanStack Query)** – Server state management and caching
* **Axios** – API request handling
